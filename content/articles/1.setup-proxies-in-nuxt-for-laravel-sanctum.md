# Setup proxies in Nuxt for Laravel Sanctum

[Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sanctum) is a great package for authenticating users in a Laravel application. It's easy to setup and use, but it has one big issue. It doesn't work well with CORS.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and it's a mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. It is a great tool for security, but it can be a pain to work with.

This means that if you have a Laravel application running on `https://example.com` and you want to make an API request to `https://api.example.com` you will get a CORS error.

This is a big issue if you want to use Laravel Sanctum to authenticate users in a Nuxt application. Nuxt runs on `http://localhost:3000` in development and on `https://example.com` in production. This means that you will get a CORS error when you try to authenticate a user in development.

## Setup proxies

The solution to this problem is to setup proxies in Nuxt. Proxies allow you to proxy requests to a different URL. This means that you can proxy requests to `https://api.example.com` to `http://localhost:3000` in development.

This way you can make requests to `http://localhost:3000` in development and `https://api.example.com` in production.

To setup proxies in Nuxt you need to edit `nuxt.config.ts` file in the root of your project. This file is used to configure your Nuxt application.

In this file you need to add a `nitro.devProxy` property.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    nitro: {
        devProxy: {
            "/proxy": process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE,
        },
    },
})
```

This will proxy all requests to `http://localhost:3000` that start with `/proxy`. So if you make a request to `/proxy/users` it will be proxied to `http://example.com/users`.

## Setup Laravel Sanctum

Now that you have setup proxies in Nuxt you need to setup Laravel Sanctum to work with proxies.

Sanctum already accepts requests for localhost:3000 so there is no need to change anything. But if you are using a different port in your Nuxt application you need to add it to the `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` environment variable in your Laravel application.

To do this you need to add the URL of your Nuxt application to the `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` environment variable in your Laravel application.

```env  
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost:5000
```

This will allow Laravel Sanctum to authenticate users from `http://localhost:5000`.

## Setup Nuxt Auth Sanctum Module

If you are using the [Nuxt Auth Sanctum Module](https://nuxt.com/modules/nuxt-auth-sanctum) you need to add the `proxy` property to the `sanctum` property in the `auth` property in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    sanctum: {
        baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000", // the URL of your Nuxt application
        endpoints: {
            csrf: "/proxy/sanctum/csrf-cookie", // prefix with your proxy prefix
            login: "/proxy/login",
            logout: "/proxy/logout",
            user: "/proxy/api/user",
        },
    },
})
```

This will make sure that the Nuxt Auth Sanctum Module makes requests to the correct URL.

## Conclusion

That's it. You have now setup proxies in Nuxt for Laravel Sanctum. You can now make requests to `http://localhost:3000` in development and `https://api.example.com` in production.
